      2026 Rookie Class: Early Fit Analysis for Top Four Draft Picks
    </h2>
    <p class="text-sm muted">
      As the League of Ordinary Gentlemen shifts its focus from playoff contention
      to offseason roster development, the upcoming 2026 rookie draft becomes the
      central storyline for the four teams holding premium selections.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <p>
      The rookie class is viewed by several analysts as top-heavy with upside —
      particularly at running back and wide receiver — and those possessing top-four
      picks will have access to the draft’s rarest commodities: projected early
      producers with multi-year dynasty value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below, we examine how the key prospects expected to headline the 2026 class fit
      with the rosters and strategic trajectories of the four teams selecting at the
      top of the board:
      <strong>
        robjanice (1.01), FireDrakes (via mydadysnotayeti at 1.02),
        A Team Has No Name (1.03), and Headhunters (1.04).
      </strong>
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 1.01 -->
  <section class="space-y-3">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold tracking-tight">
      1.01 — robjanice: A Franchise Ready for a True Cornerstone
    </h3>
    <p class="italic muted">
      Projected Fit: Jeremiyah Love (RB, Notre Dame) or an Elite WR1 Prospect
    </p>

    <p>
      With the lowest Max Points For in the league by a wide margin, robjanice enters
      the draft in clear need of foundational talent. While the roster has several
      holes, the most evident is the absence of a reliable young playmaker capable of
      elevating weekly scoring output.
    </p>

    <p>
      In dynasty formats, the first overall pick is often used on the player with both
      the highest floor and the longest runway — and in this class, that player is
      widely expected to be Jeremiyah Love, a running back with true every-down
      capability.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if a dominant wide receiver separates from the field during the
      predraft cycle, robjanice could pivot. A top-end WR offers a longer career arc
      and sustained value through roster turnover — a meaningful factor for a team
      rebuilding from the ground up.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 1.02 -->
  <section class="space-y-3">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold tracking-tight">
      1.02 — FireDrakes (via mydadysnotayeti): A Contender’s Luxury Pick
    </h3>
    <p class="italic muted">
      Projected Fit: Carnell Tate (WR, Ohio State) or Jordyn Tyson (WR, Arizona State)
    </p>

    <p>
      Few teams benefit more from the rookie draft structure than FireDrakes, who
      acquired this premium selection despite fielding one of the league’s strongest
      rosters. The 1.02 pick represents a rare opportunity to add elite talent without
      sacrificing current competitiveness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tate offers prototypical size and advanced route development, while Tyson brings
      vertical explosiveness and game-breaking ability after the catch. Either could
      contribute early while extending FireDrakes’ championship window.
    </p>

    <p>
      While a top-end quarterback could enter the conversation, an elite wide
      receiver remains the most likely — and most impactful — selection.
    </p>

  <!-- 1.03 -->
  <section class="space-y-3">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold tracking-tight">
      1.03 — A Team Has No Name: In Need of Upside and Identity
    </h3>
    <p class="italic muted">
      Projected Fit: Justice Haynes (RB, Michigan) or a Second-Tier WR with WR1 Upside
    </p>

    <p>
      A Team Has No Name enters the offseason in a transitional state. Competitive in
      moments, the roster ultimately suffers from inconsistent scoring and gaps at
      critical positions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Justice Haynes profiles as a strong fit — a running back with power, burst, and
      three-down utility who could immediately elevate a thin RB room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Should Haynes be off the board, a second-tier wide receiver with long-term
      upside may be the preferred route. This selection is as much about defining a
      direction as it is adding talent.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 1.04 -->
  <section class="space-y-3">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold tracking-tight">
      1.04 — Headhunters: Stabilizing a Volatile Roster
    </h3>
    <p class="italic muted">
      Projected Fit: Makai Lemon (WR, USC) or Best Available WR/QB
    </p>

    <p>
      Headhunters sits at an inflection point. While capable of high-end production,
      the roster lacks week-to-week stability — particularly at wide receiver.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 1.04 pick often marks the end of a draft tier. Selecting the highest-floor
      player available, such as Makai Lemon, would provide immediate stability and
      dependable production.
    </p>

    <p>
      This pick is less about transformation and more about building a reliable
      foundation for the next several seasons.

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold tracking-tight">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      The 2026 rookie class may not rival the elite depth of previous years, but it
      offers several high-upside prospects capable of reshaping franchise
      trajectories. With four teams holding premium draft capital — including a
      championship contender with a top-two pick — the early rounds will have
      lasting consequences across the league.
