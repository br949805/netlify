    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>These bylaws will govern The League of Ordinary Gentlemen, a dynasty format fantasy football league. Managers will retain the rights to all players on their roster until they are dropped or traded.</p>
    <h2>Rosters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting positions are QB, RB, RB, WR, WR, WR, TE, WR/RB/TE, WR/RB/TE, K</li>
        <li>We have a 30-player roster.</li>
        <li>In addition to regular roster spots you will be able to designate 3 players to IR if they have an official designated OUT, EXE, SUS, or IR. </li>
        <li>5 Taxi Squad spots will also be available for rookies for a maximum of 2 years. A player can only be designated to the taxi squad during the regular season their rookie year and cannot be demoted once they have been promoted to a general roster position. Rookies who have started a game cannot be placed on the Taxi Squad.</li>
        <li>Rosters will expand to 35 general roster spots each season after the Super Bowl.</li>
        <li>Rosters will need to be reduced to 30 prior to the kickoff of the first game of the season.</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>League Fees</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each manager will pay a league fee in the amount of $25.</li>
        <li>League fees will be paid by the beginning of the rookie draft.</li>
        <li>Any manager who has not paid the league fees by their pick in a round of the rookie draft will forfeit the right to participate in that round.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h2>Payout</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First Place: 60% of League Dues ($150)</li>
      <li>Second Place: 20% of League Dues ($50)</li>
      <li>Third Place: 10% of League Dues ($25)</li>
      <li>Winner of the Loser's Bracket: Automatic buy in to next season ($25 value)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rookie Draft</h2>
   <p>The rookie draft shall be a non-snaking draft, and the order shall be the inverse of the final regular season standings for non-playoff teams, with playoff teams being slotted per their final playoff standings. A manager will have the option to select any incoming rookie, Free Agent, or pass on their pick.</p>
    
   <h2>Waivers</h2>
   Waivers will be handled through Free Agent Acquisition Budget (FAAB) 
        <ul>
            <li>Each manager will receive a FAAB of $500 starting after the final NFL pre-season game and ending on Jan 1</li>
            <li>Minimum bids of $0 are allowed and bids must be in $1 increments</li>
            <li>Blind bidding dollars can be traded but cannot be carried over from year to year</li>
        </ul>
 
    <h2>Playoffs</h2>
    <ul><li>6 team playoff – Top 5 teams in the standings and the top scorer of the remaining teams will advance to the playoffs.</li></ul>
    
    <h2>Trades</h2>
    <p>Trading is arguably the most enjoyable and challenging part of running your own fantasy football dynasty team. While trading is not required in this league, it's highly encouraged and responding to trades in a timely fashion is the right thing to do. Future rookie draft picks can be traded up to 2 years in advance.
    The league's philosophy is that trades should not be overturned unless there is clear and undisputable evidence that collusion has occurred.
    Overall, these teams are yours to do whatever you want with, so don’t look for many deals to be overturned. The trade deadline is the kickoff of the first Thanksgiving game. Trading resumes after week 16.</p>
    <h2>Replacement Owners</h2>
    <p>If at any point during the year an owner needs to be replaced due to any reason, the commissioner will be responsible for finding a new owner to take over the team as soon as possible. If an owner must be replaced during the start-up draft or a rookie draft in the future, the draft will be paused if the team on the clock needs to be replaced until a new owner can be found. This is done so that the new owner doesn't get put at an unfair disadvantage by having their pick pushed back. If for some reason the commissioner has difficulty in finding a replacement during the season and a new owner is still not in place before the beginning of the next week, the commissioner will set the orphan team's lineup. The lineup will be set by using FantasyPro's consensus weekly expert rankings and will not make any roster moves.</p>
    <h2>Rule Changes</h2>
    <p>Changes to rules and settings will be considered by majority league vote. Since managers make all current decisions based on the prevailing rules at the time, and approved changes will not be incorporated until the following season, or the season after that for a change that drastically affects gameplay. If unanimous league approval is given, a change may be incorporated immediately.</p>
