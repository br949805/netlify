            <p>
              These bylaws will govern The League of Ordinary Gentleman, a dynasty format fantasy football league.
              Managers will retain the rights to all players on their roster until they are dropped, traded, or retire from the NFL.
            </p>

            <h2>Rosters</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Starting positions are QB, RB, RB, WR, WR, WR, TE, WR/RB/TE, WR/RB/TE, K</li>
              <li>We have a 30-player roster. In addition to regular roster spots you will be able to designate 3 players to IR if they have an official designated OUT, EXE, SUS, or IR.</li>
              <li>5 Taxi Squad spots will also be available for rookies for a maximum of 2 years. A player can only be designated to the taxi squad during their rookie season and cannot be demoted once they have been promoted to a general roster position.</li>
              <li>Rosters will expand to 35 general roster spots each season after the Super Bowl.</li>
              <li>Rosters will need to be reduced to 30 prior to the kickoff of the first game of the fourth week of the preseason.</li>
